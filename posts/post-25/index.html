    <p>Hash tables are one of the most important and widely used data structures in computer science. They provide a way to store and retrieve data in, on average, constant time, which makes them incredibly efficient for a wide range of applications. You've likely used them without even realizing it, as they are the underlying data structure for objects in JavaScript and dictionaries in Python.</p>
<h2>How Do Hash Tables Work?</h2>
<p>A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values. It uses a <strong>hash function</strong> to compute an index, or &quot;hash code,&quot; from a key. This index is then used to place the value in an array, often called a &quot;bucket array.&quot;</p>
<h3>The Key Components</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Key-Value Pairs:</strong> A hash table stores data as key-value pairs.</li>
<li><strong>Hash Function:</strong> This is a function that takes a key as input and returns an index into the bucket array. A good hash function should distribute the keys as evenly as possible across the array.</li>
<li><strong>Bucket Array:</strong> This is the underlying array where the values are stored.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Handling Collisions</h2>
<p>A <strong>collision</strong> occurs when two different keys hash to the same index. Since two items can't be stored in the same slot in the array, we need a way to handle this. There are two common strategies for collision resolution:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Chaining:</strong> In this approach, each bucket in the array is a linked list (or another data structure). When a collision occurs, the new key-value pair is simply added to the linked list at that index.</li>
<li><strong>Open Addressing:</strong> In this method, if a collision occurs, the hash table looks for the next available slot in the array to store the value.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>On average, hash tables provide <strong>O(1)</strong> time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups. This is because the hash function allows you to directly access the location of the data. However, in the worst-case scenario (e.g., when all keys hash to the same index), the time complexity can degrade to <strong>O(n)</strong>.</p>
<p>Hash tables are a cornerstone of modern programming. Their efficiency and versatility make them an essential tool for any developer. Understanding how they work is a key part of mastering data structures and algorithms.</p>
