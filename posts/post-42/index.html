  <section class="post-full-content">
    <p>In 2017, a paper from Google titled &quot;Attention Is All You Need&quot; introduced the Transformer architecture. This model has since become the foundation for most state-of-the-art NLP models, including large language models like GPT-3 and BERT.</p>
<h2>The Problem with Recurrent Models</h2>
<p>Before the Transformer, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs and GRUs, were the standard for sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation. However, RNNs have a major limitation: they process sequences sequentially, one token at a time. This makes it difficult to parallelize the computation and limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies in the data.</p>
<h2>The Power of Self-Attention</h2>
<p>The Transformer architecture does away with recurrence entirely and instead relies on a mechanism called <strong>self-attention</strong>. Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence when processing a particular word. In essence, it allows the model to look at other words in the sequence for context.</p>
<p>For example, when processing the sentence &quot;The cat sat on the mat,&quot; the self-attention mechanism would allow the model to understand that &quot;sat&quot; is related to &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;mat.&quot;</p>
<h2>The Transformer Architecture</h2>
<p>The Transformer architecture is composed of two main parts: an encoder and a decoder.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Encoder:</strong> The encoder takes a sequence of text as input and produces a sequence of continuous representations. It is composed of a stack of identical layers, each of which has two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.</li>
<li><strong>Decoder:</strong> The decoder takes the output of the encoder and generates an output sequence, one token at a time. It is also composed of a stack of identical layers, but in addition to the two sub-layers from the encoder, it has a third sub-layer that performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Innovations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-Head Attention:</strong> Instead of performing a single attention function, the Transformer uses multi-head attention. This allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.</li>
<li><strong>Positional Encodings:</strong> Since the model contains no recurrence or convolution, it needs a way to make use of the order of the sequence. This is done by adding &quot;positional encodings&quot; to the input embeddings. These are vectors that give the model information about the position of each word in the sequence.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Impact of the Transformer</h2>
<p>The Transformer architecture has had a profound impact on the field of NLP. Its ability to be parallelized has allowed researchers to train much larger models on much larger datasets. This has led to a series of breakthroughs, from the development of pre-trained models like BERT to the rise of large language models like GPT-3.</p>
<p>The Transformer is a testament to the power of new ideas in research. By challenging the long-held assumption that recurrent models were the only way to handle sequences, the authors of &quot;Attention Is All You Need&quot; opened up a new era of possibilities for NLP. It's a foundational concept for anyone working in modern AI.</p>
