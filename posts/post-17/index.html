    <p>Neural networks are at the heart of the deep learning revolution, powering everything from image recognition to natural language processing. But what exactly are they? This guide will give you a high-level overview of the core concepts.</p>
<h2>Inspired by the Brain</h2>
<p>At its core, a neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It's made up of interconnected nodes, or &quot;neurons,&quot; which are organized into layers.</p>
<h3>The Three Types of Layers</h3>
<p>A typical neural network has three types of layers:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Input Layer:</strong> This is the entry point for your data. Each neuron in the input layer represents a feature of your data.</li>
<li><strong>Hidden Layers:</strong> These are the layers between the input and output layers. This is where the &quot;learning&quot; happens. A neural network can have multiple hidden layers, and the more layers it has, the &quot;deeper&quot; it is.</li>
<li><strong>Output Layer:</strong> This layer produces the final result. For example, if you're building a network to classify images of cats and dogs, the output layer might have two neurons, one for &quot;cat&quot; and one for &quot;dog.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<h2>How Do Neural Networks Learn?</h2>
<p>Neural networks learn through a process called <strong>training</strong>. During training, the network is fed a large amount of labeled data. For each piece of data, the network makes a prediction. It then compares its prediction to the actual label and calculates the error.</p>
<p>This error is then used to adjust the &quot;weights&quot; of the connections between the neurons. This process, known as <strong>backpropagation</strong>, is repeated thousands or even millions of times. Over time, the network gets better and better at making accurate predictions.</p>
<p>Neural networks are a complex but fascinating topic. This was just a brief introduction, but hopefully, it has given you a better understanding of what they are and how they work. They are a fundamental concept in modern AI, and their importance is only growing.</p>
