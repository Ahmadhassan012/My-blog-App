summary: "A brief overview of the reasons for choosing Eleventy as a static site generator."

There are many static site generators out there, but I chose Eleventy for a few key reasons:

*   **Simplicity:** Eleventy is simple to get started with. There's no complex configuration or boilerplate to deal with.
*   **Flexibility:** It supports multiple template languages, so I can use the one I'm most comfortable with (I'm using Nunjucks).
*   **Performance:** Eleventy sites are fast by default. It generates static HTML files that can be served from a CDN.

I'm looking forward to building more with Eleventy!
