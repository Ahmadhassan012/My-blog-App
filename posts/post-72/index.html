    <p>In C++, it's very common to write functions that operate on a sequence of objects. The traditional way to do this is to pass a pointer and a length, or a pair of iterators. However, this can be verbose and error-prone.</p>
<p>C++20 introduced a new feature that provides a better way to work with contiguous sequences of objects: <code>std::span</code>.</p>
<h2>What is <code>std::span</code>?</h2>
<p>A <code>std::span&lt;T&gt;</code> is a non-owning view of a contiguous sequence of objects of type <code>T</code>. It's essentially a &quot;fat pointer&quot; that holds a pointer to the beginning of the sequence and a length.</p>
<p>You can think of it as being similar to <code>std::string_view</code>, but for any type of object, not just characters.</p>
<h2>How to Use <code>std::span</code></h2>
<p>You can create a <code>std::span</code> from a variety of sources, including C-style arrays, <code>std::vector</code>, and <code>std::array</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;span&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void print_span(std::span&lt;int&gt; s) {
    for (int x : s) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot;;
    }
    std::cout &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}

int main() {
    int c_array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    print_span(c_array); // Create a span from a C-style array

    std::vector&lt;int&gt; vec = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    print_span(vec); // Create a span from a std::vector

    // You can also create sub-spans
    std::span&lt;int&gt; sub_span = vec;
    print_span(sub_span.subspan(1, 3)); // Prints 7 8 9
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>print_span</code> function can now accept any contiguous sequence of integers, without having to be a template. This is a major advantage over the traditional iterator-based approach.</p>
<h2>Why Use <code>std::span</code>?</h2>
<p><code>std::span</code> offers a number of benefits over the traditional ways of working with sequences.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong> A <code>std::span</code> knows its own size. This helps to prevent buffer overflows and other common errors that can occur when working with raw pointers.</li>
<li><strong>Expressiveness:</strong> It makes the intent of your code clear. When a function takes a <code>std::span</code>, it's immediately obvious that it expects a contiguous sequence of objects.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> A single function that takes a <code>std::span</code> can be used with a C-style array, a <code>std::vector</code>, a <code>std::array</code>, or any other contiguous container.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Like <code>std::string_view</code>, <code>std::span</code> is a non-owning view. It doesn't make a copy of the data, so it's very efficient.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Dangers of <code>std::span</code></h2>
<p>Like <code>std::string_view</code>, the biggest advantage of <code>std::span</code> is also its biggest danger: it doesn't own the data. If the underlying container is destroyed, the <code>std::span</code> will be left dangling.</p>
<p>You should be careful not to return a <code>std::span</code> that refers to a local variable.</p>
<h2><code>std::span</code> vs. Pointers</h2>
<p>You might be wondering why you should use <code>std::span</code> instead of a raw pointer and a size. The main reason is safety. A <code>std::span</code> is a bounds-checked view of the data. If you try to access an element outside of the span, you will get a compile-time or run-time error (depending on the context), whereas with a raw pointer, you would just get undefined behavior.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><code>std::span</code> is a fantastic addition to the C++ standard library. It provides a modern, safe, and efficient way to work with contiguous sequences of objects. It's a key part of the C++20 effort to make the language safer and more expressive.</p>
<p>If you are writing functions that operate on sequences of data, you should consider using <code>std::span</code>. It's a hidden gem that can help you to write code that is more robust, more flexible, and easier to read. It's a simple feature that can have a big impact on the quality of your C++ code. It's a better pointer for the modern era.</p>
