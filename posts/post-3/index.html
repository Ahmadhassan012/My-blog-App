  <div class="post-content">
    <p>In the early days of the web, most websites were static collections of HTML files. As the web evolved, dynamic, database-driven sites built with content management systems (CMS) like WordPress and Drupal became the norm. However, the pendulum is now swinging back towards static, thanks to a new generation of tools called static site generators (SSGs).</p>
<h2>What are Static Site Generators?</h2>
<p>A static site generator is a tool that takes your content (usually written in Markdown), applies it to a set of templates, and generates a website made up of purely static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This pre-built site can then be served directly from a content delivery network (CDN), making it incredibly fast and secure.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular SSGs today include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eleventy (11ty):</strong> Known for its flexibility and simplicity. It's what this blog is built with!</li>
<li><strong>Hugo:</strong> Famous for its incredible build speed, written in Go.</li>
<li><strong>Jekyll:</strong> One of the originals, it powers GitHub Pages.</li>
<li><strong>Next.js &amp; Gatsby:</strong> Powerful React-based frameworks that can function as SSGs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why are SSGs Gaining Popularity?</h3>
<p>The rise of SSGs is closely tied to the <strong>Jamstack</strong> architecture (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup). This modern approach to web development offers several key advantages over traditional dynamic sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Static sites are incredibly fast because there's no database to query or server-side code to execute. The files are already built and ready to be served from a CDN close to the user.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> With no database or server-side vulnerabilities to exploit, static sites are inherently more secure. The attack surface is significantly reduced.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Serving static files is trivial to scale. CDNs are designed to handle massive amounts of traffic with ease.</li>
<li><strong>Developer Experience:</strong> Developers can use modern tools and workflows they love. Content is often managed in Git, allowing for version control and atomic deploys.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Is a Static Site Right for You?</h2>
<p>Static sites are a perfect fit for blogs, portfolios, documentation sites, and marketing websites. While they may not be suitable for highly dynamic applications like social networks or e-commerce stores (though even that is changing with hybrid approaches), they represent a powerful and efficient way to build a significant portion of the web.</p>
<p>If you're looking to build a website that is fast, secure, and a joy to develop, a static site generator is an excellent choice.</p>
