Git is the most widely used version control system in the world. Whether you're a solo developer or part of a large team, understanding how to use Git effectively is a critical skill. This guide will walk you through the essential commands you'll use every day.

## Initializing a Repository

To start tracking a project with Git, you first need to initialize a repository. You can do this in two ways:

1.  **`git init`**: Use this command in an existing project directory to create a new Git repository.
2.  **`git clone <url>`**: Use this command to create a local copy of a remote repository that already exists (e.g., on GitHub).

## The Basic Workflow

The core Git workflow consists of modifying files, staging them, and then committing them.

*   **`git status`**: This is your go-to command. It shows the current state of your working directory and staging area, letting you see which files are modified, staged, or untracked.
*   **`git add <file>`**: This command adds a file to the staging area. The staging area is a snapshot of the changes you want to include in your next commit. You can also use `git add .` to stage all modified files.
*   **`git commit -m "Your commit message"`**: This takes the files from the staging area and saves them as a new snapshot in the repository's history. The commit message should be a concise description of the changes you made.

## Branching and Merging

Branching is one of Git's most powerful features. It allows you to work on different features or fixes in isolation without affecting the main codebase.

*   **`git branch`**: Lists all the branches in your repository.
*   **`git branch <branch-name>`**: Creates a new branch.
*   **`git checkout <branch-name>`**: Switches to the specified branch. You can combine creating and checking out a branch with `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.
*   **`git merge <branch-name>`**: Merges the specified branch's history into your current branch. This is how you integrate changes from a feature branch back into your main branch.

By mastering these fundamental commands, you'll be well on your way to using Git with confidence.
