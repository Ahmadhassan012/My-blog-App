Recursion is a powerful programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It's a fundamental concept in computer science, and it's used in many algorithms, from sorting and searching to traversing complex data structures like trees and graphs.

The key to understanding recursion is to think about breaking a problem down into smaller, self-similar subproblems. A recursive function has two main parts:

1.  **Base Case:** This is the condition under which the function stops calling itself. Without a base case, a recursive function would run forever, leading to a stack overflow error.
2.  **Recursive Step:** This is where the function calls itself with a modified input, moving closer to the base case.

A classic example of recursion is calculating the factorial of a number. The factorial of a non-negative integer `n`, denoted by `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. For example, `5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`.

A recursive function to calculate the factorial would look like this:

```javascript
function factorial(n) {
  // Base case
  if (n === 0) {
    return 1;
  }
  // Recursive step
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

In this post, we'll explore more examples of recursion to help you build a solid understanding of this elegant problem-solving approach.
