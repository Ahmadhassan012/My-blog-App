Writing code is only one part of the software development process. Ensuring that the code you write works as expected is just as important. That's where software testing comes in. Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it's supposed to do. The goal of testing is to find and fix bugs before the software is released to users.

There are many different types of software testing, but they can generally be categorized into three main levels, often visualized as a "testing pyramid":

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are the foundation of the testing pyramid. A unit test is a small, isolated test that checks a single "unit" of code, such as a function or a method. Unit tests are fast, easy to write, and provide quick feedback to developers. They help to ensure that the individual components of your application are working correctly.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests are the next level up in the pyramid. They are designed to test how different parts of your application work together. For example, an integration test might check that a function correctly calls another function in a different module, or that your application can correctly read data from a database. Integration tests are slower and more complex than unit tests, but they are essential for finding bugs that occur at the boundaries between different components.

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests

End-to-end tests are at the top of the pyramid. They are designed to simulate a real user's workflow from start to finish. For example, an E2E test for an e-commerce application might involve a script that opens the website, searches for a product, adds it to the cart, and completes the checkout process. E2E tests are the slowest and most brittle type of test, but they are also the most realistic. They provide the highest level of confidence that your application is working as expected from the user's perspective.

A well-balanced testing strategy will include a mix of all three types of tests. By investing in software testing, you can improve the quality of your code, reduce the number of bugs, and deliver a better experience to your users.
