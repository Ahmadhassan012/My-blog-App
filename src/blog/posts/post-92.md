As a developer, it's not enough to just write code that works. You also need to write code that is secure. Security is a critical aspect of software development, and it's important to be aware of the common vulnerabilities that can put your applications and your users at risk. In this post, we'll take a look at two of the most common web application vulnerabilities: SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

### SQL Injection

SQL injection is a type of attack that allows an attacker to execute malicious SQL statements on a database. This can happen when you use user input to construct a SQL query without properly sanitizing it. A successful SQL injection attack can allow an attacker to view, modify, or delete data in your database.

**How to prevent it:**
- Use parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) instead of string concatenation to build your SQL queries.
- Use an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library, which will handle the SQL for you and automatically protect against SQL injection.
- Validate and sanitize all user input.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of attack in which an attacker injects malicious scripts into a web page that is viewed by other users. This can happen when you display user-generated content on a web page without properly escaping it. A successful XSS attack can allow an attacker to steal user data, such as cookies and session tokens, or to perform actions on behalf of the user.

**How to prevent it:**
- Escape all user-generated content before displaying it on a web page. Most web frameworks have built-in functions for this.
- Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
- Set the `HttpOnly` flag on your cookies to prevent them from being accessed by JavaScript.

These are just two of the many security vulnerabilities that you need to be aware of as a developer. Security is a continuous process, and it's important to stay up-to-date on the latest threats and best practices. By taking a proactive approach to security, you can help to protect your applications and your users from attack.
