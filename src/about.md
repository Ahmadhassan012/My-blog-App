  ## My Story

  I started my journey into the world of programming in high school, where I was first introduced to Python. The ability to create something out of nothing but lines of code fascinated me, and I've been hooked ever since. I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [Your University], where I'm constantly learning new things and challenging myself with new projects.

  ## My Skills

  I have experience with a variety of programming languages and technologies. Here are some of my key skills:
