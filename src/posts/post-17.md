Neural networks are at the heart of the deep learning revolution, powering everything from image recognition to natural language processing. But what exactly are they? This guide will give you a high-level overview of the core concepts.

## Inspired by the Brain

At its core, a neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It's made up of interconnected nodes, or "neurons," which are organized into layers.

### The Three Types of Layers

A typical neural network has three types of layers:

1.  **Input Layer:** This is the entry point for your data. Each neuron in the input layer represents a feature of your data.
2.  **Hidden Layers:** These are the layers between the input and output layers. This is where the "learning" happens. A neural network can have multiple hidden layers, and the more layers it has, the "deeper" it is.
3.  **Output Layer:** This layer produces the final result. For example, if you're building a network to classify images of cats and dogs, the output layer might have two neurons, one for "cat" and one for "dog."

## How Do Neural Networks Learn?

Neural networks learn through a process called **training**. During training, the network is fed a large amount of labeled data. For each piece of data, the network makes a prediction. It then compares its prediction to the actual label and calculates the error.

This error is then used to adjust the "weights" of the connections between the neurons. This process, known as **backpropagation**, is repeated thousands or even millions of times. Over time, the network gets better and better at making accurate predictions.

Neural networks are a complex but fascinating topic. This was just a brief introduction, but hopefully, it has given you a better understanding of what they are and how they work. They are a fundamental concept in modern AI, and their importance is only growing.
