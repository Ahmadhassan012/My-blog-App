Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods). Many of the most popular programming languages, including Java, Python, and C++, are object-oriented.

The main goal of OOP is to organize complex programs by bundling related data and functionality into objects. This makes the code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. There are four fundamental principles of OOP:

1.  **Encapsulation:** This is the idea of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit, or object. It also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which is a key part of data hiding.

2.  **Inheritance:** This is a mechanism that allows a new class (the child class) to inherit the properties and methods of an existing class (the parent class). This promotes code reuse and creates a clear hierarchy.

3.  **Polymorphism:** This literally means "many forms." In OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It's often expressed as "one interface, multiple functions." This allows for more flexible and decoupled code.

4.  **Abstraction:** This is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It helps to reduce complexity and allows for easier-to-understand code.

This post will provide a beginner-friendly overview of these four principles, with simple examples to help you understand how they are used in practice.
