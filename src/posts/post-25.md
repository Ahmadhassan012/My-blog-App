Hash tables are one of the most important and widely used data structures in computer science. They provide a way to store and retrieve data in, on average, constant time, which makes them incredibly efficient for a wide range of applications. You've likely used them without even realizing it, as they are the underlying data structure for objects in JavaScript and dictionaries in Python.

## How Do Hash Tables Work?

A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values. It uses a **hash function** to compute an index, or "hash code," from a key. This index is then used to place the value in an array, often called a "bucket array."

### The Key Components

1.  **Key-Value Pairs:** A hash table stores data as key-value pairs.
2.  **Hash Function:** This is a function that takes a key as input and returns an index into the bucket array. A good hash function should distribute the keys as evenly as possible across the array.
3.  **Bucket Array:** This is the underlying array where the values are stored.

## Handling Collisions

A **collision** occurs when two different keys hash to the same index. Since two items can't be stored in the same slot in the array, we need a way to handle this. There are two common strategies for collision resolution:

1.  **Chaining:** In this approach, each bucket in the array is a linked list (or another data structure). When a collision occurs, the new key-value pair is simply added to the linked list at that index.
2.  **Open Addressing:** In this method, if a collision occurs, the hash table looks for the next available slot in the array to store the value.

## Performance

On average, hash tables provide **O(1)** time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups. This is because the hash function allows you to directly access the location of the data. However, in the worst-case scenario (e.g., when all keys hash to the same index), the time complexity can degrade to **O(n)**.

Hash tables are a cornerstone of modern programming. Their efficiency and versatility make them an essential tool for any developer. Understanding how they work is a key part of mastering data structures and algorithms.
