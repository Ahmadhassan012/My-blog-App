In the early days of the web, most websites were static collections of HTML files. As the web evolved, dynamic, database-driven sites built with content management systems (CMS) like WordPress and Drupal became the norm. However, the pendulum is now swinging back towards static, thanks to a new generation of tools called static site generators (SSGs).

## What are Static Site Generators?

A static site generator is a tool that takes your content (usually written in Markdown), applies it to a set of templates, and generates a website made up of purely static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This pre-built site can then be served directly from a content delivery network (CDN), making it incredibly fast and secure.

Some of the most popular SSGs today include:
*   **Eleventy (11ty):** Known for its flexibility and simplicity. It's what this blog is built with!
*   **Hugo:** Famous for its incredible build speed, written in Go.
*   **Jekyll:** One of the originals, it powers GitHub Pages.
*   **Next.js & Gatsby:** Powerful React-based frameworks that can function as SSGs.

### Why are SSGs Gaining Popularity?

The rise of SSGs is closely tied to the **Jamstack** architecture (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup). This modern approach to web development offers several key advantages over traditional dynamic sites:

*   **Performance:** Static sites are incredibly fast because there's no database to query or server-side code to execute. The files are already built and ready to be served from a CDN close to the user.
*   **Security:** With no database or server-side vulnerabilities to exploit, static sites are inherently more secure. The attack surface is significantly reduced.
*   **Scalability:** Serving static files is trivial to scale. CDNs are designed to handle massive amounts of traffic with ease.
*   **Developer Experience:** Developers can use modern tools and workflows they love. Content is often managed in Git, allowing for version control and atomic deploys.

## Is a Static Site Right for You?

Static sites are a perfect fit for blogs, portfolios, documentation sites, and marketing websites. While they may not be suitable for highly dynamic applications like social networks or e-commerce stores (though even that is changing with hybrid approaches), they represent a powerful and efficient way to build a significant portion of the web.

If you're looking to build a website that is fast, secure, and a joy to develop, a static site generator is an excellent choice.
