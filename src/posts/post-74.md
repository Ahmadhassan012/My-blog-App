Have you ever wondered why some programs run faster than others? The secret often lies in understanding Big O notation. Big O is a way to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Specifically, it describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

This post will demystify Big O notation, explaining what it is, why it's important, and how you can use it to write more efficient code. We'll cover common complexities like O(1), O(n), and O(n^2) with practical examples. By the end, you'll have a solid foundation for analyzing and comparing algorithms.
