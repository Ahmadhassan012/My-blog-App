Whether you're a solo developer or part of a large team, version control is an essential tool for managing your codebase. Git is the most widely used version control system in the world, and for good reason. It's powerful, flexible, and has a rich ecosystem of tools and services like GitHub and GitLab.

At its core, Git allows you to track changes to your files over time. You can think of it as a series of snapshots of your project. At any point, you can look at a previous snapshot, compare it to the current version, or even revert to an older state. This makes it easy to experiment with new features without fear of breaking your existing code.

The real power of Git shines when you work with others. Git's branching and merging capabilities allow multiple developers to work on different features in parallel. Each developer can work in their own isolated "branch," and when a feature is complete, it can be merged back into the main codebase.

This post will walk you through the fundamental Git commands you need to know to start using version control in your projects. We'll cover `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git branch`, and `git merge`. By the end, you'll be ready to start tracking your own projects with Git.
